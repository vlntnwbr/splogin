# SPLogin - Automated Spotify Web Login

A simple tool to automatically create a new Spotify Web Session for use in the
Home Assisant - Spotcast Integration.

This tool automatically logs into Spotify Web to extract the values of the
Spotify cookies `sp_dc` and `sp_key` that are needed by spotcast. These values
can be used to trigger an event in Home Assistant for use in automations.
